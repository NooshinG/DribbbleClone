# Dribbble Clone

As the title says, this project is a responsive clone of [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) website. 


## Description
I created this project to practice front-end skills.
This project is responsive and built with HTML, SASS and JS. For now, it only includes "Dribbble Home page". 

Here's demo link:

and sorce code is available:

I used flex and Grid to create the layout of the page, and I also used MediaQuery to make it responsive. Images and information about them are taken from the [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api). I used FetchAPI to get data from this API.  
Working with flex, grid, fetchAPI and responsivity was exciting for me and made my coding better (though not clean).
